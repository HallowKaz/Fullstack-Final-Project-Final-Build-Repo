# Movieapp

## description
This react app allows the user to search a Movie name, and retrieve some basic details about it from the tmdb api. The user can also view a list of popular movies from the tmdb api, and can add or remove them from a "favorites" list.

## Set up instructions
The user must clone the repo, and make a config.js file in the backend directory that exports their tmdb api key. For example:

![example config.js file](https://github.com/cop4808-spring-2023-fullstack-web/final-project-Group-6/blob/main/frontend2/movie-app/public/config_example.jpg?raw=true)


To run the application, navigate to frontend/movie-app and enter "npm start" in the terminal.
Then, in a separate terminal, navigate to the backend directory and enter "node server.js" to
run the server.
